## How to use

In each branch a different project is developed. Main branch is used only as entry point.

## Branches List

* **Spring Batch**: spring-batch-billing-job (Spring Batch - Docker - PostgreSQL)

  A batch application that generates billing reports for an imaginary cell phone company called Spring Cellular. The
  application stores billing information in a relational database and generates a billing report. This application is
  based on Spring Boot and uses Spring Batch's features to create a robust batch processing system that is restartable
  and fault-tolerant.


* **OAuth 2.0**: spring-rest-oauth2 (Spring Web - H2 - REST - OAuth2)

  A REST API that manages cash cards for an imaginary cash company, Family Cash Cards. The application stores cash cards
  in an in-memory database that can be administered through a GET endpoint and one POST. This application is based on
  Spring Boot and uses Spring Security to authenticate the user, authorize each request, and provide defense against
  common web application vulnerabilities like CSRF.
